# TELECOM-CHURN-PREDICTION

Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another.To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.Churn prediction is usually more critical for prepaid customers.We need to use the usage-based definition to define churn.
